# Dice Rolling Simulator
A basic command window based game developed on **python**.
The user is presented with the option to use a **default 6-faced die** or to user his/her own die.
If the user wants to use a **custom die**, he/she needs to enter the minimum and maximum values on
the faces of the die.
The computer generates a **random value** within the range of the values on the die faces and shows
it to the user.
The user can roll the die again to get a new value or stop the app.

### Uses **nimesh_app_basics module**
The module nimesh_app_basics is a custom module made by me to help me in the development of
basic commad window based apps.
